objdump -dS vmlinux > /tmp/kernel.s
Open the generated assembly file, /tmp/kernel.s. with a text editor such as vim. 
Go to unwind_backtrace+0x0/0xf8, i.e. search for the address of unwind_backtrace + the offset. 
Finally, you have located the problematic part in your source code.

Use gdb:
Run gdb <path-to-vmlinux>.
Execute in gdb's prompt: list *(unwind_backtrace+0x10).

gdb-> disassemble crash_func (note the base address at first line)
gdb-> list *(base address in above step + offset at  crash_func);
