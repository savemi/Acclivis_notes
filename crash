objdump -dS vmlinux > /tmp/kernel.s
Open the generated assembly file, /tmp/kernel.s. with a text editor such as vim. Go to unwind_backtrace+0x0/0xf8, i.e. search for the address of unwind_backtrace + the offset. Finally, you have located the problematic part in your source code.

Use gdb:

IMO, an even more elegant option is to use the one and only gdb. Assuming you have the suitable toolchain on your host machine:

Run gdb <path-to-vmlinux>.
Execute in gdb's prompt: list *(unwind_backtrace+0x10).

gdb module.ko
gdb-> add-symbol-file module.o
gdb-> disassemble crash_func (note the base address at first line)
gdb-> list *(base address in above step + offset at  crash_func);
